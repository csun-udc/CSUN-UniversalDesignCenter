<p>As a precursor to creating a website, serving user needs should be the center of the design.</p>
<span id="usability-best-practices"></span>
<ul>
  <li><b>Audience:&nbsp;</b>Identify your primary users and what their main expectation is from your website. Make sure you incorporate the needs of different user types and what you want each user type to achieve.</li>
  <li><b>Mission-critical functions:</b> Make a list of all critical functions and consider providing a logical path to achieve these functions. Identify the best ways to help a user accomplish major tasks. (e.g. registration, search result, finding resources,
    signing up, creating profile, etc.)</li>
  <li><b>Website main objective:</b> Always keep in mind the main goal of the website and assess the content and design along the way to comply with the main objective of the website.</li>
  <li><b>Website Identity:</b> Make sure that the purpose of the website and what it has to offer is clear to the user within a few seconds of landing on the website. A clear message, wordmark, and information that would reflect the website identity should
    be provided on the landing page.</li>
  <li><b>Content type: </b>Content should be accessible and digestible to users from different background and with varying needs. Make sure that document types and resources provided are usable and align with the main purpose of the website.</li>
  <li><b>Navigation and structure:</b> M<b>i</b>nimize the level of difficulty for a user to complete a task by designing a thoughtful website structure and clear navigational path. Users should be able to easily navigate through pages, forms, and menus to
    accomplish what they expect from the website. &nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Cognitive</b> <b>load</b>: The website should reduce short-term memory load and recall.
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a method to help users keep track of their navigational path in a website (i.e. breadcrumb site navigation)</li>
      <li>Interactive elements such as buttons and links should show that they have been activated.</li>
      <li>Include important instructions (i.e. form field format) should remain onscreen as necessary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Simplicity, goal oriented: </b>The website should have minimal complexity and should be simple enough for users to accomplish their goals.
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid distracting information.</li>
      <li>Category labels should reflect their content accurately.</li>
      <li>Site navigation structure should be simple with a clear conceptual model.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Consistency: </b>Related items should be presented in similar or identical ways so no difficulties could be created for users.
    <ul>
      <li>Identical terminology should be used.</li>
      <li>Information displayed and data entered by users should be the same</li>
      <li>Visual presentations such as visual cues should be consistent through the site.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Responsiveness: </b>The website should update the system’s status and reflect any tasks that are performed by users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>Pages should load quickly, within 1-5 seconds; anything higher and users may assume the system is not working.</li>
      <li>Provide immediate feedback to users for any delays occurring.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Error tolerance, prevention, and recovery: </b>The website should be created to prevent user errors. If an error occurs users should be informed and presented with a method to correct the error.&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a simple error handling system.</li>
      <li>Provide warnings to users if they entered data incorrectly.</li>
      <li>User confirmation is required before changes are made.</li>
      <li>Provide a method for users to undo their actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Flexibility, predictability, and efficiency: </b>There should be a minimal amount of features that require unnecessary user interaction.
    <ul>
      <li>Allow the use of shortcuts, hotkeys, and accelerators.</li>
      <li>Avoid unnecessary complexity.</li>
      <li>Allow users to control the pace of the interaction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>The design can be customized to the users’ needs.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
