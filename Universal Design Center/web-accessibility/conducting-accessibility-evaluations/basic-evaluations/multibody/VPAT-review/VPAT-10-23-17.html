<p>&nbsp;A VPAT review is one of the most effective methods to evaluate the level of accessibility on a product or service. Through the VPAT review, you are evaluating what the vendor has stated regarding the product or service they are providing. &nbsp;Please
  be aware that VPAT reviews can&nbsp;ONLY&nbsp;be conducted on purchased products/service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Per CSU recommendation, when conducting a VPAT review you should always consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the VPAT out of date?</li>
  <li>Is the VPAT incomplete or is it missing metadata?</li>
  <li>Are there any discrepancies or contradictions present?</li>
  <li>Is there lack of specificity or Understanding?</li>
  <li>If “Not Applicable” status are present in the VPAT, what are the explanations for this status level?</li>
</ul>
