<p>In order to assess the level of accessibility within information technology products (e.g. web, software, applications, etc.), conducting accessibility evaluations is crucial. Through accessibility evaluations, we can bring to light potential accessibility
  barriers that could affect individuals with disabilities and find methods to reserve these barriers. Accessibility evaluations can be conducted using various tools and mechanisms. The tools and mechanisms used can range from basic questions to complex
  tools and analysis techniques to help identify accessibility gaps in a product. As you become more familiar with conducting accessibility evaluations, we will be able to move into more complex evaluation techniques.</p>
<p>Please be aware that most accessibility evaluations are intended primarily for web-based products and applications. Some of these accessibility evaluation mechanisms can be used on other information technology products such as software or devices.</p>
