<p>The following best practices for link display must be considered:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Links should always visually stand out and be easy to identify as links&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Links should stand out by a combination of color and underline.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Color should not be the only method to make a link stand out!&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Underlines should be reserved for links only. Using an underline for emphasis may cause confusion when navigating the website.</li>
  <li>If a :hover or :focus element is implemented, the hover color must be within the color contrast standards</li>
  <li>No more than 7 main global navigation links should be provided so users can easily see where they wish to navigate to without confusion.</li>
  <li>Breadcrumbs should be used when users must navigate through multiple pages</li>
  <li>Each breadcrumb trial should be a link so users can quickly navigate to their previous pages without losing their data, or using the back button.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
