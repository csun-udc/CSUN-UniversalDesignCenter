<p>The following best practices must be considered for link functionality:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Skip Navigation&nbsp;</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Websites should always have a skip navigation link to direct users to the main content of the page.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>It is recommended to have a skip navigation link that is always be at the top of the page and easily visible for everyone to see. This will allow equal access to all users to use the link to bypass the navigational menu.</li>
        <li>Avoid making the skip navigation invisible. When the skip navigation link is invisible, only certain users will have access to the link.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Document Readers /Plug-ins</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Always provide a link to download document readers and/or plugins &nbsp;</li>
        <li>When linking to a document in a different format, users should be made aware of the format the document is in.</li>
        <li>The document format should be included within the link text in parenthesis. For example the link text for a PDF document should be "<em>UDC Best Practices (PDF)</em>".</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Word mark Links</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Wordmarks should always be a link to navigate users the homepage.</li>
        <li>Wordmakr should easily be visible to all users.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Broken Links</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Website links should always be reviewed to make sure they function properly&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Broken links should be fixed as soon as they are identified</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
