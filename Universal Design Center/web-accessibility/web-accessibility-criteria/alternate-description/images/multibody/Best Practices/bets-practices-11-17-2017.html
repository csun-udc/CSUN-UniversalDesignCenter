<ul>
    <li>The alternative text must be <strong>accurately</strong> represent the image.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not </strong>use the phrases “image of” or “graphic of” in the alternative text.</li>
    <li><strong>The best method to practice is using captions this will provide equal access to all users.</strong></li>
    <li>If images have text within them, the alternative text should include the embedded text and a brief description of the image.</li>
    <li>Alternative Text should be within 8 to 80 characters long. If it is too long complex image description method should be used.</li>
    <li>If the image is a link, both the image and the link will require a description.</li>
    <li>The alt text should explain where the link goes if the image is inside an &lt;a&gt; element along with the ARIA-label attribute.</li>
    <li>Decorative images do not need alternative text. (alt=””)</li>
</ul>
