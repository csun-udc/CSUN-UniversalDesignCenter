<p>All image maps should have alternative text. An image map allows users to interact with the map to obtain information or perform an action. There are two types of image maps, a <b>client-side</b> <b>image</b> <b>map</b> is defined using the <code>usemap</code>  attribute within an <code>IMG</code> element. A <b>server-side image map</b> is not accessible via keyboard and should not be used. The image maps and its regions must be described with alternative text.&nbsp;</p>
