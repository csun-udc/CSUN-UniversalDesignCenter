<p>The best practices for accessible image maps are the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Client-side</b> image maps are the <b>preferred</b> method for image maps. Client-side image maps are keyboard accessible. Server-side image maps should only be used if it is not possible to define the interactive regions on the image map.</li>
    <li>Keyboard focus should be provided in-between the imageâ€™s regions to help users navigate through the image.</li>
    <li>When using a client side image map, users should:
        <ul>
            <li>Include alternative text for each region in the image map</li>
            <li>There should not be an ISMAP attribute within an Input or img element. This will make the client-side image map to be inaccessible via keyboard&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
