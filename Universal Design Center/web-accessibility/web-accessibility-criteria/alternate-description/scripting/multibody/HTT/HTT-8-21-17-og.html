<p>Testing methods may vary depending on the scripting language. Typically testing of the scripting language will require a review of its functionality with assistive technologies.</p>
<h3><strong>Manual&nbsp;</strong><strong>Review</strong></h3>
<p>When a scripting event is used in a webpage, it must undergo various accessibility test to ensure the scripting event is functional for keyboard and assistive technology users. &nbsp;The following test should be conducted:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Manual test to verify if mouse-handled events are accessible via the keyboard only. Review the <a href="https://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/web-accessibility-criteria-keyboard-accessibility">keyboard accessibility criteria page</a> for all
    test associated with keyboard access</li>
  <li>Manual test to verify if the scripting events are accessible to assistive technologies. The most common assistive technologies used to test scripting events include screen readers such as &nbsp;<a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS">JAWS</a>,
    <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/download/">NVDA</a>, or <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/">VoiceOver</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Compliance Sheriff uses Checkpoint group <strong>Section L</strong> for scripting. Please note that Compliance Sheriff will only identify a scripting event but will not conduct an accessibility check. A manual review is <strong>always</strong> needed.
