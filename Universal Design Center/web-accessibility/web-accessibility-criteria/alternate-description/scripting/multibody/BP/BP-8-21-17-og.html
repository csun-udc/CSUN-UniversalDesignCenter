<p><span>The best practices for scripting are the following:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Timer based JavaScript events must be long enough to give a user enough time to navigate the information, and allow them to extend the time in case they need it.</li>
  <li>JavaScript can be useful for the functionality of your website, but JavaScript cause some accessibility issues, these include:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Navigation</b>:&nbsp;Inability or difficulty navigating using a keyboard or assistive technology.</li>
      <li><b>Hidden content</b>:&nbsp;Presentation of content or functionality that is not accessible to assistive technologies.</li>
      <li><b>User control</b>:&nbsp;Lack of user control over automated content changes.</li>
      <li><b>Confusion/Disorientation</b>:&nbsp;Altering or disabling the normal functionality of the user agent (browser) or triggering events that the user may not be aware of.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Provide links to content that appears in event handlers.</li>
  <li>If an accessible JavaScript implementation is not possible, provide a non-JavaScript alternatives for users that do not have JavaScript rendering, using the &lt;noscript&gt; element.</li>
</ul>
