<p><strong>Scripting</strong> is a programming method that is used to trigger an event or populate content within the clients browser (client side scripting) in addition to client- or server-side data and content processing. For example, JavaScript is processed
  when the webpage is loaded or through an event triggered response. JavaScript allows the webpage designers to add content for user interaction and information processing. &nbsp;Server-side scripting helps validate form elements before a form is displayed.</p>
<p>When it comes to accessibility, it is important that when scripting language is used, it must be developed in such a manner that will not create barriers to accessing information. To be accessible, scripting events must be robust enough so the information
  can be <strong>accessed without using a computer mouse</strong> and can be <strong>read by assistive technologies</strong>.&nbsp;For example, event listeners may be waiting on a user to click on an object or hover over an icon for more information.
  This could become an error if there is no way for a user who does not use a mouse to access the information. If the information is still hidden even when it has keyboard focus but not mouse focus, it certainly is an accessibility issue. Alternatives
  for a hover interaction are available, and must be implemented in the page.</p>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c;">&nbsp; Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Accessible scripting is critical to ensure all users, including users with disabilities, have equal access to information. Scripting can either increase or decrease the accessibility of your webpage. Proper use of JavaScript will increase accessibility.&nbsp;
  Additional information, warnings, or instructions can be given to users through JavaScript prompts. If used improperly, however, JavaScript will make a webpage inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>
