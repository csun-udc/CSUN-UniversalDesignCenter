<p>An image map is an image that uses actionable “hotspots” or regions like links that can direct user to various resources or perform an action. Image maps <b>must</b> have alternative text to alert users what resources the links will direct them to or
  what action will be performed when a hotspot is activated. The hotspots are determined using x and y coordinates. Within those coordinates, is a link or function that will be enabled when the user activates the hot spot.</p>
<p><b>Server Side</b>&nbsp;image maps are used to identify images within an image map based on a shape.</p>
<p><b>Client side</b>&nbsp;image maps allow users to map coordinates from the image map into the html page which can then be handled by the browser of a person viewing the page.</p>
<p>When it comes to accessibility, images maps must be made in a way that allows users to navigate to all actionable regions of the image map while at the same time providing them with text alternatives to all these areas.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c;">&nbsp; Why are image maps important?</h2>
<p>Image maps increase the user’s interaction within the webpage. Ensuring accessibility will allow keyboard users, assistive technology users and other types of users to interact with the content.</p>
