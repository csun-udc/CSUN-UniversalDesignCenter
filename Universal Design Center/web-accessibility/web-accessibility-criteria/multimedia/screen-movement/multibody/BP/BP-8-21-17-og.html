<p>The best practices for accessible screen movement are the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>When moving content is used, user controls (e.g. pause, stop, and play buttons) should be provided.</li>
  <li>Make sure user controls for moving content are accessible via the keyboard and by assistive technologies.&nbsp; Refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/web-accessibility-criteria-keyboard-accessibility"><b>Web Accessibility Criteria- Keyboard Accessibility</b></a>&nbsp;for
    more information.</li>
  <li>The HTML &lt;blink&gt; tag is obsolete. The blink() element is not considered a standard method as it may not be supported in all browsers.</li>
  <li>When using animated moving content, it is recommended to include text equivalents for them.</li>
  <li>Moving content should not contain flashing, strobing, or flickering elements that flash more than three times in any one second period.</li>
  <li>Some images may contain a type of optical illusion that can have effects on users. We recommend to avoid these.</li>
  <li>Whenever possible the standard HTML5 “video” element should be used to embed a moving or animated content or clip. User controls will be associated with the moving element to manage the moving item.</li>
  <li>Include a disclaimer in the beginning of the content to warn users of the flashing or strobing elements within the content may induce seizures.</li>
</ul>
