<p>To ensure all interactive media is accessible, the following best practices must be followed:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>All videos must be captioned!</li>
  <li>Audio only files must have audio descriptions associated.</li>
  <li>If podcasts or other audio-only files are posted, such as .mp3â€™s, on a website, they must include text transcripts. Additionally, content creators are able to create a separate HTML page containing the transcript.</li>
  <li>Always manually input the captions instead of relying on auto-generated captions. Automatic captions typically display inaccurate information. Sound quality, accents or mispronunciations typically affect automatic captions and cause the wrong text to
    be displayed. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Time management when developing interactive media alternatives is key. When creating an interactive media file, it is best to consider accessibility from the beginning. It takes time to create media files and adding the alternative descriptions during
    development will streamline the process.</li>
  <li>It is recommended to post transcripts of media files on your website. The transcripts can be in HTML or a separate text file. Adding transcripts will help with site indexing and search engine optimization.</li>
  <li>Include adjustable features for captions. Users should be able to adjust the captions size, font, and color contrast.</li>
  <li>In HTML5, the track&nbsp;element allows for specific subtitles for a video. It allows the content creator to have control over the language and subtitle information.</li>
  <li>The &lt;object&gt; element is used to embed multimedia such as videos, audio, PDF, Flash, and Java applets in a webpage. Content within the element can contain images or non-text content such as links. When applying applets it is recommended to use
    the &lt;object&gt; element because the &lt;applet&gt; element is no longer used.</li>
</ul>
