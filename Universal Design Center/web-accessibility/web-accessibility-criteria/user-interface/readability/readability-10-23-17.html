<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c;" id="beginning2">&nbsp;Description</h2>
<p>Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. Readability plays a significant role while developing web content by increasing comprehension for the reader. Readability emphasizes <i>how</i> the text is <strong>written</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>organized</strong>&nbsp;and
  <strong>visually displayed</strong> for maximum reader&nbsp;comprehension.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Written Text&nbsp;</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When creating content, the written text is the single most important aspect of a web page. It is what ultimately connects the audience to the website and as such written text should always be easy to understand, at an appropriate reading level and should
  always be encoded correctly so that all web audience have access to the information. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 60px; color: #cf0a2c;">Clarity and Simplicity&nbsp;</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Written text in web content must always be <strong>clear,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>simplistic</strong> and <strong>appropriate</strong> for the content of the page. Clear and concise written text is critical to ensure a website is comprehensible for all
  users. When creating clear and simplistic written text, it is important consider the <strong>tone</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>language</strong> used to describe and make references in written text; this will ensure the audience remains engaged.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 60px; color: #cf0a2c;">Reading Level and Language Defaults&nbsp;</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The <strong>reading level</strong> of the audience must always be considered; when written text is too long or complex, the readability of the page decreases. Finally, the <strong>default language</strong>&nbsp;of the page should always be defined in
  web pages. The default language of the webpage is identified by <strong>"lang"</strong> HTML attribute that is used to provide assistive technologies the language in which the page was built upon. Therefore, the content will be read appropriately. Incorporating
  this technique will eliminate any language barriers for assistive technology users.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Organization&nbsp;</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Content organization helps readers navigate, access, and comprehend web content.&nbsp;To ensure a website is readable for all users, all content should be displayed in&nbsp;<strong>sequential order</strong>. The most important information of the page
  should always be at the forefront followed by supplemental information. Moreover, when content is broken into sections, the order of the page should remain <strong>consistent</strong>. This means, the content must always have appropriate structure and
  markup so that it can be read correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Visual Display&nbsp;</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The visual display of content is also critical to ensure the readability of the page. &nbsp;This means the content <strong>color, fonts, spacing and imagery</strong> must be thoughtful considered to ensure all content in the page is easy to perceive&nbsp;by
  users. If the visual look to the text and content organization makes it difficult for users to understand information, the readability of the page is lost. More information regarding the importance of visual display can be found in the Web Accessibility

<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c;">&nbsp;Why is it important?</h2>
<p>When users interact with content on the web, it is important that the written text remains clear and simplistic as possible so that the information can be understood by a wide array of audience. Hence, the more readable web content is, the greater the
  reach in audience. Readability in web content will ensure users with disabilities, such as users with cognitive disabilities and reading disorders, as well as users with language and cultural differences, understand the information conveyed. When the
  web content becomes too technical or the language used is too complex, it can become an accessibility barrier to not only users with disabilities or language differences, it can become a problem to all users.&nbsp;</p>
