<h4 style="padding-left: 30px; color: #cf0a2c;"><a id="rbp3"></a>Understanding the Audience</h4>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When creating written text on the web, the audience must always come first. The following questions must be considered:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Who is the audience?&nbsp;</li>
    <li>What may be the audiences knowledge on the web page subject?</li>
    <li>What does the audience need to take away from the web page?&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &nbsp;These questions will help initiate the development of the webpage that will be user-friendly and capable of meeting the audience's needs.&nbsp;

<h4 style="padding-left: 30px; color: #cf0a2c;">
            <a id="rbp4"></a>Reading Level&nbsp;
        </h4>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The reading level of the page ultimately will depend on the audience. However, it is recommended to maintain the reading level of the page as close to the average reading level of the overall population. Generally, secondary education reading level is
  the recommended approach, however, in the case of higher education, reading level can be slightly above secondary education.&nbsp;</p>

</a>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px; color: #cf0a2c;"><a id="rbp5"></a>Default Language&nbsp;</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The default language of the page must always match the language of the written text. However, there may be times when the default language and written text may not match, such as with international webpages. In those cases, the language of the target
  audience should be considered. Typically the default language is automatically encoded in English, however, it should be explicitly assigned to any element with content other than English.</p>

</a>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px; color: #cf0a2c;"><a id="rbp6"></a>Unbiased Tone</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Using an unbiased tone is critical to provide information to the widest audience possible. Phrases such as, “I feel” or “I believe” shows the content has a reader bias. However, interest articles may require this type of language, while tutorials and
  general information is best presented free of emotions, morals and/or beliefs.</p>
<a href="#beginning">
  <div class="top"> back to top </div>
</a>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px; color: #cf0a2c;"><a id="rbp7"></a>Ability-Focused Text</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When making references to specific groups of people, consider them as people first. For instance, people with disabilities rather than disabled people. The first example recognizes the person, while the later highlights the disability. Another consideration
  is acknowledging <i>how</i> the group of people prefer to be identified. Some examples include using Hard of Hearing vs. Hearing Impaired and Learning Differences rather than Learning Disability. An ability-focused mindset supports inclusion efforts
  and maintains the focus on what a person can do.</p>

</a>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px; color: #cf0a2c;"><a id="rbp8"></a>Gender/Pronoun Neutral Language</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Omitting the use of gender labels and pronouns neutralizes written text. The phrasing he/she could assume specific roles on the reader. This could alter how the information is received. Use phrasing such as, “the reader” or “the student” provides a gender-neutral
  text. Pronouns can detract viewers from reading a text. A common practice is to use the pronoun, “you” in written text. However, information with pronouns could unintentionally place blame and/or point fingers at the reader.</p>

</a>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px; color: #cf0a2c;"><a id="rbp9"></a>Fact/Evidence-Based Citations</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Facts and evidence-based citations strengthen and provide validity to written text. Specifically, articles and journals in the field of education heavily rely on research-based phrasing to base decisions grounded in evidence rather than a guess or assumption.
  Highlighting peer-reviewed work shows a reader additional thought and consideration was spent during the development process of the information/content.</p>

</a>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px; color: #cf0a2c;"><a id="rbp10"></a>Affirmation Centric Language</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Phrasing sentences with a positive approach shifts the focus to a “can do” message. For instance, the phrasing, “be productive” encourages affirmation while, “don’t procrastinate” focuses on the negative. Furthermore, consider readability text free of
  extreme language (never, always, only) which can narrow the focus of the reader and present a hidden bias. Using phrases such as, “consider” or “be mindful” encourages the reader to analyze the content on a deeper level.</p>

<h3><a id="rbp2"></a>Organization</h3>
<p>Overall organization helps readers navigate, access, and comprehend web content both technically and visually. Best practices for organization are divided into the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#rbp11"><strong>Content organization</strong></a>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong><strong><a href="#rbp12">Paragraph structure</a></strong></strong>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px; color: #cf0a2c;"><a id="rbp11"></a>Content Organization</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Consider the following questions and strategies while initially building/constructing/developing a new web content page:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <li>What is the written text i.e. tutorial (teaching) or article (informing)?</li>
  <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <li>Strategies:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Select proper web layout type</li>
      <li>Use proper language to align with the type of information</li>
      <li>Use style headings</li>
      <li>Split content into sections by category or topic (relevant to content)</li>
      <li>Consider the amount of information presented on a single page</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Who will be reading the text i.e. colleagues, public, etc.?</li>
  <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <li>Strategies:</li>
    <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
      <li>Use <a href="http://www.readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php">Readability Checker</a> to align grade level with audience</li>
