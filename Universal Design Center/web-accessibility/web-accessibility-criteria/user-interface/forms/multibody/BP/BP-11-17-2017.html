<p>Visit the&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/best-parctices-accessible-forms">Best Practices for Accessible Forms</a>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;for a complete list of best practices for accessible form making,&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide form labeling controls</li>
    <li>Use the &lt;label&gt; element, with appropriate For and ID attributes.</li>
    <li>It is recommended to use WAI-ARIA elements for additional accessibility support.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Always group associated forms: Use the &lt;fieldset&gt; and &lt;legend&gt; elements to group and associate related form controls.</li>
    <li>Provide form instructions&nbsp;to help users understand how to complete the form and individual form controls.</li>
    <li>Form input must always&nbsp;be&nbsp;validated</li>
    <li>Users should be allowed the ability to review data entries and undo changes and confirm data entry</li>
    <li>User should receive Notifications&nbsp;about successful task completion, any errors, and provide instructions to help them correct mistakes.</li>
    <li>Divide long forms into multiple smaller forms that constitute a series of logical steps or stages, and inform users about their progress.</li>
    <li>Groupings of form controls, typically groups of related checkboxes and radio buttons, sometimes require a higher level description (such as "Shipping Method" for a group of shipping option radio buttons).</li>
    <li>Use "activate" rather than "focus" as a trigger for changes of context</li>
    <li>When forms have symbols, such as an asterisk, to indicate a required form field, the symbol must be defined.</li>
    <li>Users must be notified that a form has a field-specific requirement such as a required date format (mm-dd-yy)</li>
</ul>
