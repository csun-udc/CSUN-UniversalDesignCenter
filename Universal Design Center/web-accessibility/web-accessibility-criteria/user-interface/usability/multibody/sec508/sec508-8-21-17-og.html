<p>Usability and user experience design is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Specifically, the International Standards Organization (ISO) defines usability as the “extent to which a product can be used by specified users
  to achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use” (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/usable">WCAG</a>).</p>
<p>The Four Principles of Accessibility layout foundation needed for accessible and usable content:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>P</strong>erceivable</em> - Information and the user interface must be presented to users in such a way that they can view or otherwise consume the content.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Users must be able to access the information being presented no matter what; all elements must not be hidden in any sort of way.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>O</strong>perable</em> - User interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><b>U</b>nderstandable</em>- Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><b>R</b>obust</em> - Content must be adaptive enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of users, including those using assistive technologies.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The content should be simple enough that it can be interpreted and understood by various users.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
