<p>Since usability encompasses a variety of concepts, testing for usability requires an overall test of the critical functions of a website. Testing can be done through machine tests with prescribed navigation paths or through remote or in-person task-based testing involving users.</p>

<h3>Usability Testing Checklist</h3>
<p>Testing can also be done visually. To determine if a website contains content that is user-friendly use the following checklist:&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">Accessibility</h4>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Site load time is reasonable</li>
        <li>Font size/spacing is easy to read</li>
        <li>Styles and colors are consistent</li>
        <li>Ads &amp; Pop-ups are not intrusive</li>
        <li>Major headings are clear and descriptive</li>
        <li>HTML page titles are descriptive</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">Identity</h4>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Homepage is digestible in 5 seconds</li>
        <li>Tagline makes website’s purpose clear</li>
        <li>Clear path to contact information</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">Navigation</h4>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Main navigation is easily identifiable</li>

<h3>Questions Content Creators Should Ask Themselves</h3>
<p>Content creators should ask themselves these questions to help determine if their website is accessible:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does my website do the things people want it to do?</li>
    <li>Can people quickly find what they want without help?</li>
    <li>Do people make lots of mistakes using my website?</li>
    <li>Can everyone use my website?</li>
    <li>Making a website usable begins with how the users will interact with your website. How people interact with a website can make all the difference, and excluding any user may tarnish the site’s credibility.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The best testing method is to have outside participants n&shy;&shy;avigate through your website and state their interaction experience. Since content creators are familiar with the website’s content, there might be a bias which may result in inaccurate results. Gathering the opinions of others who have not interacted with the website before is preferred. During the testing phase, it is important to make a note on how the users interact with content and if they are any parts of the website that are unclear or difficult to understand.</p>

<h3>When to Test</h3>
<p>Testing should be performed whenever any major design or content change – such as navigation, site structure, labeling, forms, visual display, or interactive elements -- affects the user experience of one of the critical functions of your site.</p>
<p>Content creators and testers should have a clear understanding of the mission critical functions (what you want the users to achieve and expect from your website) which define the main objective of a website.</p>
<p>In other words, it is essential to identify the level of difficulty to accomplish a task on the website.</p>
