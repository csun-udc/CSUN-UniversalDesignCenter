<span id="usability-description"></span>
<p>Usability is about designing content with a user-friendly approach. When developing a website, it is important to consider the user experience, which refers to how users will interact with a website. Creating a user-friendly interface will allow for ease of access, understanding, and use of the information, which can make all the difference for users.</p>
<p>Usability encompasses a variety of concepts to ensure a user-friendly interface. Overall, the concepts fall under the following categories: user needs, visual simplicity, and design architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">User Needs</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Content creators must understand that not everyone interacts with a website the same way. &nbsp;Users can vary by abilities; users can be visual learners, auditory learners and they can also vary by age and prior knowledge. For instance, visual learners may need charts, graphs or illustrations to help them understand the material. On the other hand, auditory learners may need to hear podcasts or watch videos to interpret the information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is important to keep in mind the different perspectives and methods of interaction each user will have. When constructing an application or website, expect users to make errors. Try to anticipate where users will go wrong and create designs that mitigate this possibility.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Visual Simplicity</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Content must be simplified so it can be understood by a wide array of users from targeted audiences. This is not to say that content should be “dumbed down” or overly simplified for users. When content is too simplified, it becomes a disservice to users as it could result in missing information. The content should, therefore, be simple enough so that all users can interpret the information and leave little room for misinterpretation.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Design Architecture</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The design architecture must always be organized, structured and labeled in such a way that will make it easier for users to know where they are, what they have found, and what to expect on the webpage (<a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/information-architecture.html">usability.gov</a>). Serving the user should be the centerpiece of website architecture. This means a website should focus around the users’ point of view.A thoughtful design should encompass all critical functions of a website specific to the type of user (e.g. student, staff, and faculty). In addition, the website design should be predictable and simple. Creating unique structures and navigation methods may leave website visitors confused and frustrated. Users should expect consistent functionality throughout the site and not have different a different navigation system for each page.</p>

<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c;">&nbsp; Why is Usability Important?</h2>
<p>There are different types of users, including users with cognitive disabilities or non-native speakers, who prefer a variety of interfaces such as mobile, keyboard-only, or assistive technologies. The content of the webpage must be usable and simple enough for all users to understand. This will allow developers to reach out to a wider audience and have the content be comprehensible.</p>
<p>A website creator can measure their success by seeing how many of their site’s visitors understood their content and had a positive user experience. The users will be able to gather new information from your website, and you will be able to get your ideas and information across to the users. Accessible websites are a win-win situation for the users and content creators.</p>
