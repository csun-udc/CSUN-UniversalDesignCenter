<p>The best practices for time repose include the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a page/system has a time limit, the user should have an option to adjust/extend the time.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Users should be provided proper time-out notification for any page that has time limit constraints.</li>
  <li>The time-out notification should provide clear instructions to the user for extending the time-out limit. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>A time limit notification should be provided after 10 minuets of inactivity.</li>
  <li>For pages with specific time limits, a user should be notified of a timeout in the last 10% of the time allowed. &nbsp;For example, if a page has a 20 minute time limit, a user should be notified in the last 2 minutes of the time out. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>User should be given sufficent time to act on a time out notification. It is recommend to provide users at least 1 to 2 minuets to act on a notification. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>When a time out notification appears, the focus should be shifted to the alert so an assistive technology user is immediately notified of the session expiring soon.</li>
  <li>Consider the type of alert you will be using to shift focus to the message. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
