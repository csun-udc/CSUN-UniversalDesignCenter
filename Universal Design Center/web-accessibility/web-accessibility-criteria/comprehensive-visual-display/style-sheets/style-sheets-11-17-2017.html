<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c;">&nbsp;Description</h2>
<p><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong>&nbsp;is a coding language that allows developers to provide style and format to a website, by allowing them to modify the fonts, colors and layouts, thus creating a certain look and feel. Although styles sheets can provide an aesthetically pleasing layout on a website, they do not provide accessibility and some users may find it easier to access web content without style sheets. Therefore to ensure accessibility, websites must be organized so that they can be easily read without needing style sheets. This means the website functionality and structure must remain the same regardless of the use of style sheets or not. If <strong>information is missing when the style sheets are disabled</strong>, it is considered an accessibility error. Alternatively, it is considered an error if <strong>additional information is present when the style sheets are disabled </strong>that is not visible when the style sheets are enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c;">&nbsp;Why is it important</h2>
<p>The user always has ultimate control over the styling of a page they view. To make a site accessible, we need to define accessible styles, but also allow flexibility for users to change or edit the styles for their own ease of access. Users may define their own styles for various reasons including: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>a need for larger text to read content</li>
    <li>a need to override page colors so they can perceive the page better</li>
    <li>a need to remove formatting for easier processing and learning of information</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it is important that when users modify the style sheets, the functionality and content of the page should still be available to users. At the same time, it is important to keep your webpage equally accessible to all individuals. If there is hidden text, or additional &nbsp;information displayed when CSS is disabled, then users who do not modify the styles would not be able to access that information.</p>
