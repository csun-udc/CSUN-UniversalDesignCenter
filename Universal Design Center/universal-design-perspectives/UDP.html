<p>Universal design (UD) and accessibility are aimed to create content that is inclusive for all and does not discriminate against age, size, gender, ability or disability. Universal design and accessibility are not just for individuals with disabilities, they cater to people with different learning styles and preferences such as those who are visual learners and even English as a Second Language (ESL) learners. However, when universal design and accessibility methods are not practiced it will have a greater impact on those with disabilities.</p>
<p>As stated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C):&nbsp;<strong>"<a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/5417"><span>Accessibility: essential for some, useful for all.</span></a>"</strong></p>
<p>This webpage contains videos created by W3C that demonstrate different ways universal design and accessibility affects everyone. They illustrate how people with disabilities, learning styles, and preferences benefit from accessibility and universal design in their everyday life.</p>
