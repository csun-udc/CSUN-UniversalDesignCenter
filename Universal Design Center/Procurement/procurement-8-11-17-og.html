<h2>Electronic and Information Technology</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">In accordance with <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&sectionNum=11135">California Government Code 11135</a>, the California State University (CSU) system requires that all programs, services, and activities of the CSU be accessible to all students, faculty, staff, and members of the public. This includes working to ensure that all electronic and information technology (E&amp;IT) products are also universally accessible. The CSU's policy on accessibility as articulated in <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-926.html">Executive Order 926 (EO926)</a> is guided by the CSU Accessible Technology Initiative (ATI) as stated in the <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/AcadAff/codedmemos/AA-2013-03.html">ATI Coded Memorandum AA-2013-03</a>. &nbsp;The CSU ATI focuses on the elimination of accessibility gaps within three key areas: web, instructional materials, and procurement. &nbsp;The CSU ATI Procurement Process requires that vendors who provide Electronic and Information Technology (E&amp;IT) products to campuses within the CSU system, must also provide documentation about their products accessibility and must work with the CSU system and campuses to mitigate accessibility issues and concerns in the products they are providing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CSUN ATI Procurement Process</h2>
<div>
<p>In accordance with CSU policy and the law, CSUN has put in place the ATI Procurement Process&nbsp;to ensure that E&amp;IT products purchased on the CSUN campus are accessible to everyone. The ATI Procurement Process requires that vendors who provide E&amp;IT products to campuses within the&nbsp;CSU&nbsp;must also provide documentation about their products accessibility and must work with the CSU to mitigate accessibility issues and concerns in the products they are providing. &nbsp;Through the CSUN ATI Procurement Process, all E&amp;IT products undergo an E&amp;IT review to determine the impact the product will have on the University. Following the E&amp;IT review, products identified as having high campus impact undergo additional evaluation and requesting departments must complete supplemental documentation about their products.</p>
