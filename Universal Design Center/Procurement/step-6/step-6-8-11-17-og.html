<p id="beginning5">As requesting departments develop their EEAAPs, products with the highest impact will be placed in the queue to undergo an Accessibility Compliance Evaluation by the Universal Design Center. The accessibility compliance evaluation is a targeted accessibility
  test to identify key gaps on a product based on Federal and State laws and standards regarding accessibility.</p>
<p>When UDC completes their evaluation, they will submit a report to requesting departments. Requesting departments must forward this report to vendors along with an accessibility roadmap to initiate the remediation of the product.</p>

<h3>UDC Evaluation</h3>
<p>The UDC evaluation will occur following the first year of the purchase of the product. All products identified as high impact will be placed in the queue to be evaluated by UDC based on priority. When time comes for your product to be evaluated, a UDC
  staff member will contact you to gather more information about the product to initiate the accessibility review. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>UDC evaluation vs. evaluation for EEAAP</h3>
<p>The UDC evaluation is a technical assessment of an E&amp;IT product to identify the underlining problems as a result of accessibility gaps.&nbsp; The UDC Review is not to be confused with the preliminary evaluation for EEAAPs; the purpose of the preliminary
  evaluation is to identify the general accessibility problems in a product to establish departmental accommodation plans. The UDC review conducted by trained UDC staff and student employees will evaluate the deepest layers of the product to identify
  key technical issues in order to address accessibility barriers and to develop an Accessibility Roadmap. The review will be conducted according to accessibility standards defined by Section 508, WCAG 2.0, CSUATI Criteria, Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP),
  Mobile Web Application Best Practices (MWABP), and Mobile Accessibility Guidelines.</p>

<h3>UDC Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<p>The UDC evaluation will consist of either a targeted compliance evaluation test or a VPAT review. The UDC targeted test is centered on evaluating the most critical accessibility criteria. UDC testers will conduct manual compliance testing on the product
  where testers will stimulate the experience of users with various disabilities and will conduct a review of the product code to identify accessibility gaps on a technical level. In some cases, UDC may also conduct a targeted evaluation using an automated
  accessibility evaluation tool, Compliance Sheriff. For Information on UDC Evaluation Criteria please visit the <a href="http://www.csun.edu/universaldesigncenter/web-accessibility-criteria">Web Accessibility Criteria</a> and <a href="http://www.csun.edu/universaldesigncenter/compliance-sheriff">Compliance Sheriff </a>&nbsp;pages.
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the VPAT Review, UDC testers will review the VPAT by analyzing the stated accessibility level of the product as defined by the vendor. For information on conducting VPAT reviews refer to the
  <br /> <a href="http://teachingcommons.cdl.edu/access/procurement_process/VPAT.shtml">CSU Voluntary Product Accessibility template (VPAT Review)</a>.</p>

<h3>UDC Evaluation Report</h3>
<p>Requesting departments should review the report to find out if the solutions/recommendations provided can be implemented and applied by the department. In addition, the report needs to be forwarded to the product vendors along with the accessibility roadmap
  template. Vendors should use this information initiate the roadmap. See Step 7 for more information.</p>

<h3>Products Undergoing UDC Evaluation</h3>
<p>Not all products will be evaluated by UDC. UDC will primarily evaluate products that are software or web application. Other products may undergo different evaluation means separate from UDC. In addition, some products are currently under a system-wide
  evaluation through the CSU Office of the Chancellor. Products identified in the Chancellors Office list will not be evaluated by UDC.&nbsp;</p>
