<p id = "beginning2">Once requestors submit their E&amp;IT Form and VPAT, their request will undergo an E&amp;IT review. The request will be reviewed by one of the three ATI Procurement team departments (Purchasing, Equity and Diversity or Universal Design Center), to determine the impact of the product. &nbsp;When the impact is established, some products may be required to undergo additional evaluation and requestors will need to provide supplemental documentation about their product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is impact?</h3>
<p>In accordance with the ATI procedures, all E&amp;IT products &nbsp;undergo an E&amp;IT review based on their impact. Impact is defined as the overall effect an E&amp;IT product will have on the campus, and could include a combination of the type of end user, number of users, and effect on student learning. Impact is categorized into three levels: Low impact, medium impact, and high impact. A higher impact level increases the need to ensure that the purchased product is universally accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Identifying Impact</h3>
<p>Impact determination is primarily centered on campus-wide involvement. The more people involved in the usage of a product, the greater the impact of the product and the higher the likelihood that further accessibility review and materials will be needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some of the key questions we consider when identifying impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the product?</li>
<li>Who are the targeted users of the product?</li>
<li>How many people will use this product?</li>
<li>How will the product be used on campus?</li>
<li>Where will the product be used?</li>
<li>What is the likelihood that this product could impact people with disabilities?</li>
<li>Could individualized accommodations be an efficient use for the product?</li>
</ul>
<p>These key questions serve as our framework to establish the appropriate impact for the product.</p>
