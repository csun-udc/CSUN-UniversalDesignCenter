<p id = "beginning4">An Equally Effective Alternate Access Plan (EEAAP) is a document used to record accessibility gaps for the product you have chosen to purchase. The main purpose of the EEAAP is to identify known workarounds and describe how equally effective alternative access will be provided should an accommodation request arise. Requestors will be notified via email if they are required to complete an EEAAP for their product and must complete&nbsp;<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/CSUN_EEAAP.docx">Equally Effective Alternate Access Plan (EEAAP)</a>&nbsp;Template</span>&nbsp;(DOCX)&nbsp;<img class="file-icon media-image img__fid__343711 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large" title="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" alt="File icon" src="/modules/file/icons/x-office-document.png" /></b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>New Procedure:</b></p>
<p>Beginning fall 2016, requesters will be required to develop an EEAAP within 30 days after notification of an EEAAP is needed. The Universal Design Center will be opening up training to complete an EEAAP. Anyone interested in participating in the EEAAP training should email UDC at <a href="mailto:udc@csun.edu">udc@csun.edu</a></p>
<h3>Before developing the EEAAP</h3>
<h4 style="color: #d00d2d;">Establish a Multi-Disciplinary Team</h4>
<p>Before initiating the EEAAP, requesting departments need to establish a multidisciplinary team that will be responsible for the EEAAP. &nbsp;The multi-disciplinary team should consist of individuals who:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a clear understanding of what the product is.</li>
<li>Know how the product will be used on campus.</li>
<li>Will be involved in the support and maintenance of the product.</li>
<li>Have knowledge of accessibility features and gaps are present in the product/service.</li>
<li>Understand what resources and strategies should be deployed to ensure equal access opportunities &nbsp;for persons with disabilities.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to complete an EEAAP</h3>
<h4 style="color: #d00d2d;">Section 1: Plan Creator Information</h4>
<p>Provide the name and contact information of the person responsible for developing the EEAAP. If there is more than one person responsible, provide the names of the other responsible individuals in Section 3.3.</p>
<h4 style="color: #d00d2d;">Section 2: Description of Affected System, Software, Process or other E&amp;IT Purchase</h4>
<ol>
<li><b>Affected Product is a:</b> Select the type of product from the list of items. If the product is “other”, explain what type of product it is.</li>
<li><b>Product Name:</b> Provide the full product name of the item to be purchased. If applicable, include a version number in this section.</li>
<li><b>Product Description:</b> Provide a brief description of what the product is and what are its key features or functions.</li>
<li><b>Product Purpose:</b> Identify what the purpose of the product will be on the campus, who will it affect, and where will it be used?</li>
</ol>
<h4 style="color: #d00d2d;">Section 3: How will “Equally Effective Alternate Access” be provided?</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Description of the issue:</strong>This question requires your multi-disciplinary team to provide a summary or list any potential accessibility gaps on the purchased product. To answer this question, your team should conduct a preliminary evaluation to self- identify the level of accessibility and the potential accessibility gaps in the purchase.</li>
<h5 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 18x;"><i>Conducting Preliminary Evaluations</i></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">To conduct a preliminary evaluation, your team should review the <a href="http://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/basic-evaluation-techniques">UDC Basic Evaluation Techniques</a> web page. The web page provides information to conduct a basic accessibility review are via a 4 question <b>Accessibility Questionnaire</b> and by a <b>Voluntary Product Accessibility Template Review</b>. It is up to the EEAAP to determine which basic evaluation technique they should perform.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">For EEAAP teams who would like to conduct a more technical preliminary evaluation of their product, the <a href="http://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/intermediate-evaluation-techniques">Intermediate Evaluation Techniques</a> and <a href="http://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/advanced-evaluation-techniques">Advance Evaluation Techniques</a> web pages will provide the team instructions, tools and techniques to conduct either of these evaluation types.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">Please be aware that some products may be selected for a comprehensive ATI Review by UDC (See Step 6: UDC Evaluation for more information).</p>
<li><strong>Person or groups affected:</strong> List potential individuals or groups who can be affected by the accessibility gaps in the product.</li>
<li><strong>Responsible person(s):</strong> Provide the names and contact information of all individuals responsible for providing accommodations for the product.</li>
<li><strong>How will EEAA be provided?:</strong> Provide a detailed summary of all identified equally effective alternative access solutions. For assistance in identifying alternative access solutions please contact, DRES or NCOD. If more space is needed, add an attachment document.</li>
<h5 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 18x;"><i>How to Identify Equally Effective Alternative Access Solutions</i></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">Your EEAA solutions will be different dependent on the product, intended use of the product, departmental resources and expertise. Your Multi-disciplinary team can contact the following offices for assistance in identifying potential EEAA solutions that will best meet a department’s needs:</p>

<ol><ol>
<ul>
<li>The Plan Creator and Departmental Chair/Manager should sign in the appropriate sections</li>

</ul>
</ol></ol>
<h4 style="color: #d00d2d;">Section 5: EEAAP Approval (Departments as appropriate)</h4>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>If the requesting department consulted with additional departments such as DRES or NCOD, a representative from those departments (department director or consultant) must sign the EEAAP.</li>
<li>No signature from DRES or NCOD is needed if the departments were not consulted.</li>
<li>Once all appropriate departments have signed, the EEAAP should be submitted to the Universal Design Center (Room OV 5, Mail Code 8235).</li>
<li>The Universal Design Center will review the EEAAP and sign.</li>
<li>UDC will maintain the original copy of the form.</li>
<li>A copy will be sent to all responsible individuals.</li>
<li>If requesting departments need additional copies, they can be provided upon request.</li>
