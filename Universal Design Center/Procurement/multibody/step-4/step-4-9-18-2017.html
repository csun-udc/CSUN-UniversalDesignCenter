<p id = "beginning3">Following the impact analysis, requestors will be notified via email of the outcome of their E&amp;IT review. If the product was identified as Medium or High impact, further evaluation and documentation are required. Below is a summary of the impact analysis outcomes:</p>
<h3>If a Product is identified as High Impact, then:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility review of the product will be required. UDC will conduct a compliance evaluation or a VPAT review on your product.</li>
<li>Equally Effective Alternate Access Plan is needed
<ul>
<li>An equally effective alternate accessibility plan must be developed by the requesting department.</li>
<li>In the EEEAAP requestors must outline key information explaining how equally effective access will be provided for individuals who may have problems using their product due to accessibility barriers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accessibility Roadmap is needed</li>
<ul>
<li>An Accessibility Roadmap is a remediation commitment plan to be completed by vendors.</li>
<li>If an accessibility roadmap is needed, requestors must request vendors to complete this plan.</li>
<li>The plan should outline all known or potential accessibility barriers in the product and should establish a remediation timeline for the issues.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The plan should also identify any known workarounds and any remediation obstacles present in the product.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>If a product is identified a Medium Impact, then:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Product could be subject to a VPAT review by UDC</li>
<li>EEAAP is recommended
<ul>
<li>An EEAAP is not required for medium impact purchases, but it is highly recommended</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accessibility Roadmap will be recommended only if students are impacted by product
<ul>
<li>If a moderate amount of end users will be students, it is highly recommended that a remediation commitment plan is developed by the vendor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Please Note:</i> If UDC identifies a high volume of accessibility concerns during the VPAT review, the product impact level could change resulting in an EEAAP and Accessibility Roadmap to be required</p>

<ul>
<li>Individualized accommodations should be considered in the event that accommodations are requested</li>
</ul>
