<p>Per CSU ATI Policy, vendors who provide E&amp;IT products to all campuses within the CSU must work with the CSU and campuses to mitigate any accessibility issues or concerns in the products they are providing. As a result, once requesting departments have received the Compliance Evaluation Report by UDC, requesting departments should submit the report to vendors in order to develop a <b><a href="http://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/CSUN_Accessibility_Roadmap.docx">CSU Accessibility Roadmap</a> (DOCX)&nbsp;<img class="file-icon media-image img__fid__343716 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large" src="/modules/file/icons/x-office-document.png" border="0" alt="File icon" title="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" /></b>. The Accessibility Roadmap is a remediation commitment plan whose purpose is: to engage vendors in listing the accessibility gaps in their product as identified in the accessibility evaluation or VPAT review, get a commitment timeline for remediation of these gaps and to define any available workarounds for accessibility gaps.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Vendors must complete the Accessibility Roadmap in order for future purchases or renewals of their product to occur. Moreover, vendors who fail to provide a roadmap may be at risk from being unable to contract with all campuses within the CSU.</p>
