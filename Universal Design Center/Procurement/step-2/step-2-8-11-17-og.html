<p id="beginning">Once you have established if your product must undergo the ATI Procurement procedure, the first step is to complete the E&amp;IT Procurement form. This E&amp;IT Procurement Form is intended to provide information about the use and purpose of the product
  in order to determine the impact of the product on campus. &nbsp;The E&amp;IT form must be completed by the department requesting the E&amp;IT purchase. The E&amp;IT Procurement form can be found on the <a href="http://www.csun.edu/procure/purch-ati-procurement-procedure">ATI Procurement Purchasing Website</a>.</p>
<p>It is critical that requesting departments complete the E&amp;IT procurement form with as much accuracy as possible. Failure to provide accurate information on the form could result in delays in the purchases of your product and could prevent your product
  from being purchased.</p>
