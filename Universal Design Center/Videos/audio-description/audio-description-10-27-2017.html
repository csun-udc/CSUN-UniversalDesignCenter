<span id="AD-description"></span>
<p>Audio descriptions are audio tracks or transcripts that contain narration of onscreen movement or visuals. They are mainly intended for users with visual impairments such as blind and low vision users. Audio descriptions have a narrator that describes
  any important content that is not conveyed through audio such as settings, graphics, and on-screen activity. They are commonly used for pre-recorded material such as video tutorials, video resources, and instructional videos.</p>

      <p>There are three types of audio descriptions:</p>
    </div>

</div>
<ol>
  <li><b>Closed audio description:</b> Users can turn the audio descriptions on or off</li>
  <li><b>Open audio description:</b> The audio description is played automatically and users are unable to turn the audio description off</li>
  <li><b>Real-time audio description:</b> Live commentary or narration is provided by a trained audio describer. This is most commonly found in live theater and live events</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c; text-align: left;">&nbsp;Do I need audio descriptions?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Yes –</strong><span> if the video contains graphic elements that are not explained by the narrator in the video.</span></li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No –</strong> if the narrator in the video describes all the actions and graphic elements portrayed in the video. If a video does not portray content through visuals it does not need audio descriptions, but the video would require captioning.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c; text-align: left;">&nbsp;How to create audio description</h2>
<p>According to the Digital Gov article,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/06/30/508-accessible-videos-how-to-make-audio-descriptions/">How to Make Audio Descriptions</a>&nbsp;there are three methods to creating audio descriptions.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Built-in video descriptions:&nbsp;</b>The best and easiest way to create audio descriptions is to have the narrator or speaker in the video describe the visuals and important onscreen action while recording the audio. If the original audio of the
    video describes illustrations, movement, and any sort of visual content then, they are not required to create an audio description.</li>
  <li><b>Create separate&nbsp;videos:&nbsp;</b>The second-best option is to create two versions of the video. The first can include the original audio for the video. The second video can include the audio description track.</li>
  <li><b>Two audio tracks:&nbsp;</b>The last option is to have two audio tracks attached to the video and allow users to choose&nbsp;between the original audio and audio description.</li>
</ol>
