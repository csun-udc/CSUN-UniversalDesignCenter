<h3><em><strong>Example 1:</strong></em> Universal Pictures Audio file and Video&nbsp;</h3>
<span id="examples-EX1"></span>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The example below is a video of the Universal Pictures intro/ logo. Above the video, however, there is a link to the audio track of an audio description. In the audio description, the audio describer explains the "Universal" logo shown in all Universal
  Pictures films. The describer begins by describing the setting in the video first (e.g.:"a black sky a sliver of sunlight crests the earth..."). This is followed by a description of the words on the screen. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Example 3: Transcript Examples</h3>
<p>The following is an audio description transcript provided by the <a href="http://www.afb.org/info/living-with-vision-loss/using-technology/video-description/123">American Foundation for the Blind.</a></p>
<p>The transcript shows the correct method to use the audio and audio description tracks. &nbsp;In the video, TV host, Jeff Corwin is the speaker. In addition to Jeff, a "female narrator's voice" serves as the audio describer. When Jeff swims towards an
  object and the female narrator announced his movement in the transcript by saying, "Jeff swims among the fish and kelp in the deep water. He points out a flower shape". &nbsp;Jeff then begins to talk about the flower shape object. For users who are
  unable to visually see the content in the video, it would be difficult for them to comprehend what Jeff is referring to. A written transcript is located below the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Jeff Corwin:</i></b><i> Hey there. I'm Jeff Corwin. So you can enjoy the full TV experience, many shows now provide video description. Many people who are blind or have difficulty understanding visual cues find video description. The description is available through your TV set-up menu.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Female narrator's voice:</i></b><i> Jeff swims among the fish and kelp in deep water. He points out a flower shape.</i></p>

  <p>This example of an audio transcript displays what type of visual content in a video is announced. For example, the describer in the transcript announces the title that appears when the video begins. The describer reads the title and reports what the
    teacher is doing, and what the image the teacher is showing looks like. The describer then announces when the teacher hands students two wooden sticks. It was important for the describer to announce this because it gives an insight on what the teacher
    will do next. The teacher says they will pretend to be birds, and the describer says the teacher held the two sticks near her mouth in the shape of a beak. Without this additional information provided by the audio describer, viewers with visual impairments
    would not have known about everything that was happening in the video.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><i>Describer:&nbsp;</i></strong><i>A title, "Teaching Evolution Case Studies. Bonnie Chen." A teacher shows photographs of birds with long, thin beaks.</i></p>
