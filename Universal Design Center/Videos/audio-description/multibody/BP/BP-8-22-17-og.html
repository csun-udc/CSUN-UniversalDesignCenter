<ul>
  <li>Audio descriptions can be time-consuming and costly. When designing videos avoid the need of audio descriptions by embedding the descriptions in the original narration of the video. For example, if a video contains a presentation showing four key sections;
    the narrator might say, “The four key sections are…” This will provide all users with the key points of a video without having to add audio descriptions.</li>
  <li>YouTube currently does not support audio descriptions. If you are using YouTube, it is recommended to upload two versions of the video; one with the audio description and one with the default audio.</li>
  <li>The narration should not overlap the audio of the original video.</li>
  <li>Visual presentations with no audio do not require audio description. However, they do require text transcripts to translate all the visual elements, graphics, figures, etc. that are present.&nbsp;</li>

<h3>Writing Audio Descriptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Narrators should depict what is seen without interpretation or comment.</li>
  <li>The passage of time within scenes should be described.</li>
  <li>The narrator should describe events in present tense.</li>
  <li>Narrators should be observant and announce movements, visuals, or body language.</li>
  <li>For live performances, the audio describer should attend rehearsals, and read the script prior to the show to prepare an audio description.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
