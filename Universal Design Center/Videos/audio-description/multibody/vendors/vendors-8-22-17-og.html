<p>Videos that contain plenty of visual information such as graphs and charts may be time-consuming to audio describe. As a result, &nbsp;instead of content creators making the audio description themselves, most seek the creation of audio descriptions through vendors.&nbsp;Vendors have professional describers and writers to translate the descriptive visual content. It is recommended for audio description creators to understand the context included in the video. Some audio description creators might miss key points in the multimedia when attempting to describe visual content. Prices may vary by Vendor as they vary by project and video basis.</p>
