<h3>Faculty</h3>&#13;
<p>Videos, audio, captured lectures, recorded presentations — instructional media — must all have closed captions. This is existing federal law, state law and CSU policy. Regardless of location (classroom, Canvas, etc.), all instructional media with audio must be captioned.</p>&#13;

<p>If you will be teaching or presenting live via video, using a videoconferencing tool like Zoom, you’ll want to have someone else handle the captions for you.  Learn more about <a href="http://www.csun.edu/it/zoom"><span>captions in Zoom</span></a>.  Contact us for a list of companies who specialize in live captioning.</p>&#13;
