<p>Usability errors commonly occur when web pages fail to take into account the various best practices needed for usable web pages. The examples below include the most common usability errors encountered in webpages. &nbsp;They are: <a href="#tca">tiny clickable areas</a>, <a href="#VLC">visited links color</a>, <a href="#FFS">fixed font size</a>, and <a href="#ST">structured text</a>&nbsp;errors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="tca"></a>Tiny Clickable Areas</h3>
<p>Tiny clickable areas create a barrier to users with low vision or mobility impairments, preventing them from accessing information. The small areas can be difficult to navigate to when using a mouse, or can often be overlooked due to small font size. For example, in the mobile view (responsive mode), the clickable area should be big enough for the user to be able to touch the clickable item.&nbsp; Use CSS techniques to expand the clickable area.</p>
<p>The image below is an example from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/9-common-usability-blunders/">Smashing Magazine</a>&nbsp;showcasing tiny clickable areas. The links “18 comments,” “16 comments” and “discuss” are difficult for users to navigate to and see. Although keyboard-only users may navigate to links easily, other users such as mouse-users or users with mobility impairments may not. Providing large clickable areas will allow all users to visually see and access content.</p>

<h3><a id="VLC"></a>Visited Links Color&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Links that do not change color make it difficult for users to track the sites they have visited. Visited links should display different colors so users will have a record of the links they have visited.</p>

<h3><a id="FFS"></a>Fixed Font Sizes&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Fixed font sizes prevent users from increasing the text. Users who have difficulty reading content may need to increase the font size to increase the websites readability. Providing tools and mechanisms to allow users to manually change the font size of the webpage will make accessing web information easier for them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="ST"></a>Structured Text&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Unstructured text is plain text without headings or short paragraphs or text with no styles. Large blocks of text can be difficult for users to read and might cause them to feel overwhelmed with information. Instead, break the content into sections for easier reading. Add headings to each page to separate all the sections and to organize the entire page. Avoid using extremely long or wordy sections. The content and only include information that the user needs to know. For more information on breaking up blocks of text, visit the Lynda.com video on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lynda.com/Design-Page-Layout-tutorials/15-Break-up-large-blocks-text/147012/360841-4.html">15 ways to break up large blocks of text</a>.</p>
<p>Content-heavy websites will discourage users from interacting with the website. It is recommended to visually separate the page using headers and lists, different text styles such as bold and italics, color, and images. This will make it easy for the user to scan the page and navigate to the section that pertains to them.</p>
<p>The image below is an example of unstructured&nbsp;text. The website shows text-heavy paragraphs with minimal paragraph breaks or headings to separate each section. When users visit this first view the set of paragraphs it may overwhelm them. As users start to read, they may have difficulty reading and focusing on the content. Other users may abandon the website at first glance due to its lengthy appearance.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>The image below is an example of structured text. The text has frequent paragraph breaks in between sections and has headers to label each category. The paragraphs are organized and contain a good amount of white space. The text structure makes it easier for users to visually digest the information and allows them to navigate directly to the content in which they are interested in.&nbsp;</p>
