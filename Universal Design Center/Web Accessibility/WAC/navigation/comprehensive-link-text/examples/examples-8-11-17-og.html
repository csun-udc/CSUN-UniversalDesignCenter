<h3 id="beginning2">Descriptive Link text</h3>
<p>The screenshot below displays the list of links view that assistive technology users will interact with when finding links on the page.&nbsp;It is important to have &nbsp;comprehensive link text so assistive technology users can understand the intent
  of the link. If the link text was “Read More” or “Click here”, users would not have any context to where the links will take them.</p>
