<h2><strong>Example 1: Alt Text&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<span id="examples-wac-images"></span>
<p>The image below is a meaningful image that needs a text alternative via alt text or caption. If alt text were used good alternative text for this image would be:<strong> <code> &lt;Img Alt= "Duck in a Pond"&gt;&nbsp;</code></strong></p>
<p>[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"526636","attributes":{"alt":"Duck in a Pond. Alternative Text Example","border":"0","class":"media-image","height":"248","style":"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;","typeof":"foaf:Image","width":"330"}}]]</p>
<h2>Example 2: Captions</h2>
<p>The example below is another meaningful image that needs either alt text or a caption. &nbsp;If a caption were used, it could provide additional context may not otherwise be seen in the image.&nbsp;</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_original","fid":"526616","attributes":{"alt":"","border":"0","class":"media-image","height":"333","typeof":"foaf:Image","width":"500"}}]] <figcaption>Orange Trees from the CSUN Orange Grove</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Example 3: Sentence Description&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Providing an image description within the context of the page is a third basic method for describing images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"526641","attributes":{"alt":"","border":"0","class":"media-image","height":"245","style":"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;","typeof":"foaf:Image","width":"330"}}]]</p>
<p>The male is metallic blue on the crown, the feathers of the head being short and curled. The fan-shaped crest on the head is made of feathers with bare black shafts and tipped with blush-green webbing. A white stripe above the eye and a crescent shaped white patch below the eye are formed by bare white skin. The sides of the head have iridescent greenish blue feathers. The back has scaly bronze-green feathers with black and copper markings. (Example derived from <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/">W3C</a>)&nbsp;</p>
