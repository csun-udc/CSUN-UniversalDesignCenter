<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c;">&nbsp;Accessible Technology Initiative (ATI) Governance</h2><p>In compliance with <a href="http://teachingcommons.cdl.edu/access/policy/documents/AA-2015-22.pdf">Coded Memoranda AA-2015-22</a> (PDF) and <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/AcadAff/codedmemos/AA-2013-03.html">Coded Memorandum AA-2013-03</a>, the Executive Sponsor for California State University, Northridge (CSUN), convenes the ATI Steering Committee at least twice each year.</p><p>Since that steering committee is comprised of executive administrators, among others, and because there are so many units on the CSUN campus that work on or with accessible technology, it is in CSUNâ€™s best interests to have subcommittees and working groups that report up to the ATI Steering Committee, as outlined below. Where possible, existing CSUN committees have assumed these ATI responsibilities. In addition, other CSUN committees include ATI representatives.</p><p>[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"default","fid":"617031","attributes":{"alt":"","border":"0","class":"media-image","height":"479","style":"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;","typeof":"foaf:Image","width":"828"}}]]</p><figure><figcaption>Organizational chart for ATI governance, as described below.</figcaption></figure><h3>ATI Steering Committee</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/ati-steering">ATI Steering Committee</a> extends the Executive Technology Steering Committee (ETSC) and oversees the work of all of the sub-committees.</p><h4>ATI Services Committee</h4><p>The <a href="https://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/ati-services">ATI Services Committee</a> reports up to the ATI Steering Committee, and guides the work of the other sub-committees.</p><h5>ATI College and Divisional Coordinators</h5><p>The <a href="https://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/ati-coordinators">ATI Coordinators</a> are the first point of contact for ATI in their respective areas.
