<ul>
  <li>Campus training needs related to accessibility;</li>
  <li>The most concerning current uses of materials and technologies that are not yet accessible;</li>
  <li>The available and needed resources for assisting faculty and staff in selecting accessible products and/or making materials and technologies accessible;</li>
  <li>Workable standards for documenting alternative accommodation plans; and</li>
  <li>Other actions that could be taken to insure that accessibility considerations become common business and educational practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meeting Schedule: Once per month (as needed)</p>
