<p>The <a href="http://www.csun.edu/it/governance-wcg">Web Coordination Group (WCG)</a> is an ad-hoc working group reporting to the Executive Technology Steering Committee to coordinate the web content management system for University administrative web
  pages, to review University web projects (including ongoing and future division web projects), and make recommendations and identify issues to ETSC as appropriate. The committee meets monthly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>WCG serves as the Web Accessibility group, coordinating through the Universal Design Center Program Manager with the ATI Services Committee. The group will review and revise the campus Web Accessibility Plan. The Group and the Plan will serve in support
    of the work that the other areas across campus do to support and advance the accessibility of the campus web presence.</li>
