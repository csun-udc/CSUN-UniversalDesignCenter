<p>The <a href="http://www.csun.edu/it/governance-acat">Advisory Committee for Academic Technology (ACAT)</a> consults on the management of University-wide IT support of instructional and scholarly activities, from the perspective of a college or division, not individual users. The committee meets monthly.</p>
<ul>
<li>ACAT serves as the Instructional Materials Accessibility Committee to review and revise the campus Instructional Materials Accessibility Plan. The Committee and the Plan will serve in support of the work that the Faculty Technology Center (FTC), Universal Design Center (UDC), and other areas across campus do to support faculty and ensure our students have accessible instructional materials.</li>
