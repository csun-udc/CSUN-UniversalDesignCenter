<h2 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #cf0a2c;">&nbsp;Laws and Legislation Overview</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 1990</h3>
<p>“<a href="http://www.ada.gov/">The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)</a> <a href="https://www.ada.gov/2010_regs.htm">prohibits discrimination and ensures equal opportunity</a> for persons with disabilities in employment, State and local government services, [and] public accommodations....” As a state university, an employer, and a resource to the community, California State University, Northridge (CSUN) is bound by the ADA. The ADA extends to and includes the technologies used by the campus.</p>
<p>For more about ADA compliance at CSUN, please contact <a href="http://www.csun.edu/eqd">Equity and Diversity</a>.</p>
<h3>Accommodations: Section 504, amended 2008</h3>
<p><a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/504faq.html">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a> requires CSUN to provide “accommodations” – <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/auxaids.html">auxiliary aids and services</a>&nbsp;– to students with disabilities.&nbsp; The goal of these accommodations is to provide access to information and activities that is equally effective to that enjoyed by other students.&nbsp; <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/transition.html">Accommodations are provided to an individual student</a> based on his or her request and the information the student provides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of accommodations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Note-takers;</li>
<li>ASL interpreters;</li>
<li>Braille copies of materials; or</li>
<li>Software that provides assistance.</li>
</ul>
<p>At CSUN, contact <a href="https://www.csun.edu/dres"><span>Disability Resources and Educational Services&nbsp;</span>(DRES)</a> to <a href="https://www.csun.edu/dres/student-services">request accommodations for students</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Accessibility:&nbsp; Section 508, revised 2017</h3>
<p>Accommodations are important but don’t solve every potential barrier.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a>&nbsp;requires CSUN to go further and make our information and communication technologies accessible to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students and members of the CSUN community do not have to request accessible features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites and electronic documents that conform to technical standards and guidelines; or</li>
<li>Captioned videos.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Final Standards and Guidelines</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/the-board">United States Access Board</a>&nbsp;published the updated Section 508 on January 18, 2017, as the <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines">ICT Final Standards and Guidelines</a>. &nbsp;The revised standards and guidelines take a functionality or performance-based approach (“what it <b>does</b>”) instead of the former product-based (“what it <b>is</b>”).&nbsp; Electronic documents were covered by the previous standard, but are explicitly addressed in the refresh. &nbsp;The revised standards and guidelines include cognitive and learning disabilities and limited strength, and add a requirement that, if a function or disability is not covered elsewhere, it is covered by the “Functional Performance Criteria.” The revised standards and guidelines also require that technology on campus interoperate with assistive technology: the accommodations from Section 504.</p>
<p>The ICT Final Standards and Guidelines align Section 508 with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>.&nbsp; WCAG 2.0 is the internationally accepted standard for accessible websites.</p>
<p>The ICT Final Standards and Guidelines also incorporate Section 255, covering telecommunications equipment, content and services.</p>
<h3>21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA), 2010</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/21st-century-communications-and-video-accessibility-act-cvaa">CVAA</a> addresses communication technology and videos.&nbsp; It requires communication services and devices to be accessible to people with disabilities.&nbsp; It requires videos available through the Internet as well as television to be captioned, and it requires devices used to access videos to support captions.</p>
