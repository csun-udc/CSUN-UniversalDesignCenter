Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles support inclusive learning environments to engage all learners. Using these principles to drive development and design of instructional content ensure instructional materials will be readily available for
all students. Consider the following while developing, re-designing, or collecting instructional material: Creating accessible documents Formatting digital text (headers, styles, color contrast, chunking information, etc.) Providing closed captions, transcripts,
and/or audio descriptions on multimedia Developing a UDL-based syllabus (PDF) Collecting instructional materials with learner variability in mind Incorporate the UDL guidelines (PDF)
