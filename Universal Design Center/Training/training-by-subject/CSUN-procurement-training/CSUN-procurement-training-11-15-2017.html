In addition, departments purchase Information Communication Technology (ICT) products that have a significant impact on students, faculty, staff and/or public, departments are required to submit an EEAAP to the ATI Procurement Committee. &nbsp;EEAAP training is a general workshop to assist departments who are required to submit an EEAAP.
